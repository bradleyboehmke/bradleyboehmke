Back in March I wrote a [post](http://bradleyboehmke.github.io/2016/03/data-wrangling-with-r.html) about writing a book on R.  I was fortunate enough to have this book picked up by [Springer](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319455983) for the [Use R!](http://www.springer.com/series/6991) series. [Data Wrangling with R](http://bradleyboehmke.github.io/books/) was just published and is now available to purchase through [Springer](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319455983) or on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Wrangling-R-Use/dp/3319455982/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1476410448&sr=8-1&keywords=data+wrangling+with+r). This book will guide you through the data wrangling process along with give you a solid foundation of working with data in R.
