Made good progress this week on the [http://uc-r.github.io/](http://uc-r.github.io/) website. I was able to tutorials posted for:

- Introduction to R
- R Basics
- Data Types
   - Vectors
   - Characters
   - Regex
   - Factors
   - Dates
   - Missing values
- Data Structures
   - Vectors
   - Lists
   - Matrices
   - Data Frames
   
Most of these tutorials I had previously developed from the [Data Wrangling with R book](http://bradleyboehmke.github.io/books/) and only required minor modifications. I hope to get tutorials regarding functions, importing/exporting, scraping, simplifying with the `%>%` operator, tidying and transforming data completed next week.
