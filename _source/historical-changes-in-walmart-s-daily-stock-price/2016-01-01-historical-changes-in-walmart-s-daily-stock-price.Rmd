Last Tuesday October 14, Walmart's stock price dropped by 10.04% due to their dim outlook on next year's predicted profits.  This drop was, reportedly, one of the [biggest single-day declines in Walmarts history](http://www.wsj.com/articles/wal-mart-lower-sales-earnings-outlook-1444835896) leaving the closing adjusted stock price at $60.03; the lowest its been since May 23, 2012.<!--more--> However, last Tuesday's drop was one of only eight times in history in which the daily stock price change was greater than -10% with the last occurance happening on January 8,1988.

To compare the magnitude of historical daily price changes I pulled [data](http://finance.yahoo.com/q/hp?s=WMT) dating back to 1972.  I focused only on the adjusted closing prices to normalize the historical stock prices and account for stock splits that have occurred.  The average daily price change has been 0.08% with a > 99% probability of being between -5.7% and 5.9%. Historically, the daily change has *decreased* greater than the > 99% probability threshhold (-5.7%) 68 times.  Prior to Tuesday, the last time this occurred was January 8, 2009.  

However, including Tuesday's -10.04% decrease, Walmart's stock price has only decreased by -10%+ eight times in its history.  Prior to Tuesday the last time was January 8, 1988 when [Sam Walton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Walton) announced he was stepping down as CEO resulting in a -10.27% decrease.  On October 16, 1987 Walmart's price dropped -11.79% as part of the ["selling avalanche"](http://www.multiagent.martinsewell.com/Iori.pdf) that occurred the few business days prior to [Black Monday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Monday_(1987)).  The remaining five indidents occurred between 1973-1974 likely due to the ['73-74 bear market crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973%E2%80%9374_stock_market_crash).
