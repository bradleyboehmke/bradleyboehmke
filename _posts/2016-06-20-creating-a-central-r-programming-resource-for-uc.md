With my new role of providing more robust R programming knowledge to the students in the [Business Analytics M.S. program](http://business.uc.edu/graduate/ms-business-analytics.html) at the University of Cincinnati, I've been thinking about developing a GitHub repository to act as a central repository and website of tutorials and other R resources. It may also serve as a way to get students more familiar with GitHub and version control by getting them involved with developing tutorials or pushing/pulling R exercises from the website.

Not sure where it'll go but I think it has potential. I developed a shell [repository](https://github.com/uc-r) and got the bare bones website up and running at [http://uc-r.github.io/](http://uc-r.github.io/).
