## Study Questions

**Q1:** What do you see as the main advantages of evaluating a program using a randomized experiment (RCT)?

- it is a fair allocation rule and therefore it shields program managers from potential accusations of favoritism or corruption
- will produce two groups that have a high probability of being statistically identical, as long as the number of potential participants to which we apply the randomized assignment process is sufficiently large
- with a large enough number of observations, the randomized assignment process will produce groups that have statistically equivalent *averages for all their characteristics*
- treatment and comparison groups that are generated through randomized assign- ment will be similar not only in their observed characteristics but also in their unobserved characteristics
- the comparison group controls for all factors that might also explain the outcome of interest
- the internal validity of an impact evaluation is ensured through the process of randomized assignment of treatment
- allows you to test new or potentially costly programs whose intended and unintended consequences are unknown
- estimating the impact is easy when RCTs are performed correctly $$y_1 - y_2$$


**Q2:** What do you see as the main drawbacks of evaluating a program using a randomized experiment (RCT)

- At higher levels of aggregation (i.e. province level, country level) the sample size may not be not sufficiently large to yield balanced treatment and comparison groups
- chances of spillover can be high when the unit level is low (i.e. households, individuals)
- Treatment and comparison households need to be located su ciently far from each other to avoid such spillovers
