## Study Questions

**Q1:** What is the Kenyan government trying to achieve by deworming school children? What is the "theory" that persuaded education leaders to focus on deworming children rather than some other more traditional education intervention?

**A1:** Parasitic worm infection leads to a depletion of the body's necessary nutrients causing victims to gradually grow weaker. Symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal pain, anemia, and blood in urine and/or stool. In children, this results in lethargy and the inability to concentrate which studies have linked to impaired cognitive development and decreased educational achievement. 

Consequently, providing a deworming program can reduce these impacts and allow children to realize their potential and maximize their educational experience. Furthermore, a deworming school program offers the "spillover effect" and was shown by [Miguel & Kremer (2004)](http://cega.berkeley.edu/assets/cega_research_projects/1/Identifying-Impacts-on-Education-and-Health-in-the-Presence-of-Treatment-Externalities.pdf) to have a significantly larger positive impact than just treating at the individual level. Plus, many Kenyan's have historically not sought out treatment on their own because of the commonality of the issue (it's been accepted as normal) and lack of proximity to clinics for treatment.  Lastly, Miguel and Kremer showed that due to the low cost of mass treatment and the high impact to school attendance, a school deworming program is the most cost effective approach. Combined, these issues informed policy makers that a school level effort was required rather than relying on a more traditional education intervention or individual treatment effort.


**Q2:** What is the “evidence” on which the Deworming Kenya program is based? Who generated the evidence? What is it about the way this evidence was generated that makes us “believe” the claims of the researchers?

**A2:** Although several prior studies assessed deworming programs at the individual level, it was [Miguel & Kremer's](http://cega.berkeley.edu/assets/cega_research_projects/1/Identifying-Impacts-on-Education-and-Health-in-the-Presence-of-Treatment-Externalities.pdf) study that was the "key research breakthrough." 

> *"For the first time, deworming had been viewed through an economic lens and was shown to be extremely cost effective in comparison to other education interventions. It helped change how the education sector and the development community viewed school health and deworming."*

The primary reason this research was so compelling was because it was a randomized study at the school level. This meant that Miguel & Kremer were able to control for deworming treatments at the school level (either some or all of the students at a particular school were treated versus schools where no treatment was offered).  

> *"Randomization at the school level allowed for the quantification of the overall effect of school deworming on a school, thereby accounting for spillover effects on untreated children within a school."*


**Q3:** Carrying out this intervention is complicated and involves many people who ordinarily do not work together. What does this suggest for who needs to be involved in the planning and implementation?

**A3:** It needs to be <u>organized</u> and <u>well planned</u> so that the people responsible for the intervention know how to execute the program (p.8 para. 3).  There needs to be <u>clarity</u> so that people know specifically how many people are impacted and where they are located (p. 9 para. 3). There needs to be <u>strong coordination</u> so that the program and can take advantage of existing organizations, resources, tools, and efforts (p. 9 para. 5). It needs to be <u>properly funded</u> so that procurement can happen...and happen when necessarily rather than relying on budget cycles (p. 9 para. 5).  <u>Roles and responsibilities need to be clearly delineated</u> so that people and organizations know exactly what part they play (p. 10 para 5). The intervention needs the <u>ability to scale</u>. This includes the ability to acquire necessary resources and to provide the capacity for training and execution of activities.


**Q4:** Why is it important to pay attention to how a program like deworming Kenya is implemented? What could go wrong? What could you learn about the intervention by watching the implementation?

**A4:** A program like this is great to observe because so much can (and will) go wrong but when it is executed well you can learn so much. It's also a real set of problems rather than abstract research problem sets that can be finessed to some extent. So observing a well executed policy implementation can let you see all the moving and opposing parts that need to organized and executed. You can also learn how potential research attributes can become unrealistic in policy applications. This can help you learn how to approach future research efforts or guide assumptions in your academic research. Lastly, it provides you the full picture from evidence identification (research) to policy implimentation and all the messing components in between.

> *"Good evidence by itself is meaningless unless it is making a difference in terms of policy and impact on people."* - Michael Mills, Lead Economist, World Bank


**Q5:** Do you think this was a successful initiative? Why or why not? 

**A5:** From the perspective of how research should feed policy decisions...yes, I do believe it was successful. As Michael Mills quote above suggests, the purpose of research should be to make a difference in policies and, ultimately, positively impact the people.  This initiative has, so far, influenced the policies. However, time will tell if the policy will have a positive impact on the people.  So I also believe the success of the initiative is still yet to be determined.
