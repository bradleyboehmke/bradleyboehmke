## Study Questions

**Q1:** What is the Jamaican government trying to accomplish with this change in the way the social safety net is structured?  

Purpose of this study: To determine if PATH is reaching its intended population and increasing the human capital of poor households as measured by school attendance and health care usage

They identify poverty being linked to:

- Education: Although poor children are typically enrolled in school, they sometimes do not attend regularly
- Health care: Inadequate prenatal care has been a serious problem

Overarching Goal: prevent a reversal in the significant declines in poverty witnessed in the 1990s and to ensure that the poor were adequately protected

Question Zero (1): For youth, preventive programmes, which ought to begin during the early childhood development stage, should lay the foundation for better developmental outcomes and lead to high returns later in life. 

Question Zero (2): For adults, regular checkups should improve individuals’ health and chronic illness monitoring and reduce emergency visits.

Prior safety nets:

- low effectiveness
- failed to reach targeted audience
- lack of awareness of the programs
- inadequate benefit levels

the reform effort focused on four major areas:

1. Developing and implementing a universal targeting system based on a proxy means test
2. Consolidating major cash and in-kind transfer programs to ensure:
   - A meaningful level of benefits
   - A cost-efficient and accessible delivery system
   - Access to benefits linked to desirable behavioral changes
   - Effective targeting
3. Improving the targeting, efficiency, and impact of programs
4. Developing systems to monitor and evaluate the programs

**Q2:** What is the essence of Jamaica’s PATH Program?  What is its underlying theory of change? Theories of change?

The essence of the PATH program:

- replace three major income support programmes that provided cash or in-kind assistance: the Food Stamps Programme, the Poor Relief Programme, and the Public Assistance Programme
- to fight poverty in the present through monetary transfers and to reduce poverty in the future by encouraging poor households to invest in the health and education of their children

PATH is organized around two components:

- provide health and education grants for eligible poor children through age 17 based on school attendance
- provide grants to poor pregnant or lactating mothers, elderly poor (over age 65), and poor, disabled, and destitute adults under age 65 (initially conditioned on regular health visits)


**Theory of Change (1):** IF you provide education grants based on attendance THEN parents will push their kids to increase school attendance, THEN kids will get more education, THEN kids will experience better developmental outcomes and THEN kids will experience higher returns later in life

**Theory of Change (2):** IF you provide grants to poor pregnant or lactating mothers and the elderly based on health visits THEN these individuals will increase be more likely to get regular checkups and THEN this should improve individuals’ health and chronic illness monitoring and reduce emergency visits


**Q3:** In designing a process evaluation, it is useful to construct a flow chart of the program you are evaluating.   As you sketch your flow chart of the PATH Program, think about the paths through which three key elements will flow:  people, money and data/information.  


**Q4:** What are the underlying logic models for the Jamaica PATH Program?  How would working out the detailed logic models help you design a process evaluation and monitoring strategy?

<img src="http://bradleyboehmke.github.io/public/images/harvard/Logic_Model.png" title="Logic Model" alt="Logic Model" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

The logic model should identify the inputs, processes required, and the outputs/outcomes assumed to occur.  This will help identify the metrics that need to be developed, monitored, and reported along with the time intervals for which data should be collected and reported.


**Q5:** What are the most important questions to address in your process evaluation?  What does that suggest for a potential research design?

> *Process evaluation, in Scheirer's (1994) words, "verifies what the program is and whether or not it is delivered as intended to the targeted recipients." It does not, however, attempt to assess the effects of the program on those recipients.* (p. 171)

Program process evaluation schemes are designed to answer such evaluation questions as these:

- How many persons are receiving services?
- Are those receiving services the intended targets?
- Are they receiving the proper amount, type, and quality of services?
- Are there targets who are not receiving services or subgroups within the target population who are underrepresented among those receiving services?
- Are members of the target population aware of the program?
- Are necessary program functions being performed adequately?
- Is staffing sufficient in numbers and competencies for the functions that must be performed?
- Is the program well organized? Do staff work well with each other?
- Does the program coordinate effectively with the other programs and agencies with which it must interact?
- Are resources, facilities, and funding adequate to support important program functions?
- Are resources used effectively and efficiently?
- Is the program in compliance with requirements imposed by its governing board, funding agencies, and higher-level administration?
- Is the program in compliance with applicable professional and legal standards?
- Is performance at some program sites or locales significantly better or poorer than
at others?
- Are participants satisfied with their interactions with program personnel and procedures?
- Are participants satisfied with the services they receive?
- Do participants engage in appropriate follow-up behavior after service?

The evaluator or other respon- sible parties must not only describe the program's performance but also assess whether it is satisfactory

Process theory identifies the aspects of program performance that are most important to describe and also provides some indication of what level of performance is intended, thereby providing the basis for assessing whether actual performance measures up


**Q6:** How will you use the information you gather in your process evaluation?  Who will use it?

Process evaluation plays two major roles:

1. It can stand alone as an evaluation of a program in circumstances where the only questions at issue are about the integrity of program operations, service delivery, and other such matters
2. as a complement to an impact evaluation..."A full impact evaluation, therefore, includes a process component to determine what quality and quantity of services the program provides so that this information can be integrated with findings on what impact those services have."

Process evaluation generally provides information about program performance to:

- program managers 
- and other stakeholders


**Q7:** Why is it important to continuously monitor a program once it is up and running? How might your process evaluation design and findings influence what you choose to measure over time (e.g. performance measures)?

- Such process monitoring can be a useful tool for facilitating effective management of social programs by providing regular feedback about how well the program is performing its critical functions
- This type of feedback allows managers to take corrective action when problems arise and can also provide stakeholders with regular assessments of program performance
