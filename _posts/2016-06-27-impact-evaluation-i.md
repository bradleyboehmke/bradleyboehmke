## Study Questions

Skip Q1

**Q2:** In the deworming case study you read for session #1, the researchers conducted an impact evaluation:

**a.** What were the key outcomes of interest? The key long-term outcomes were increased school attendance which ultimately should lead to increased IQ and economic growth for Kenya. The short-term outcome (or moreso output) for the implementation process was to have all kids in the selected areas to take a deworming tablet.

**b.** How did the researchers estimate (or mimic) the counterfactual? In the Miguel & Kremer study the counterfactual was estimated by schools randomly selected that did not get the deworming tablets. The original program was going to provide deworming tablets to all schools in selected areas; however, a shortage in tablets left that option unattainable.  So, the researchers randomly selected schools in these areas to not be included.  Consequently, the treatment group and control group had similar characteristics so the counterfactual could be adequately measured by the control schools.

**c.** Did you find the strategy in 2b convincing? Yes.
