## &#9313; Of Money
Hume laid out very clearly his doctrine that prices of commodities are proportional to the money circulating in a market. This is what is now considered the [quantity theory of money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity_theory_of_money). Hume argues that although a surge in money can have an initial boost in labor and productivity output, in the long run it is relatively neutral. This is quite clear in his statement:

> *"...it is of no manner of consequence, with regard to the domestic happiness of a state, whether money be in a greater or less quantity."*

Although he argues that money is neutral in the long run, Hume also argued that the best possible policy was a gently increasing money supply. Primarily because it "keeps alive a spirit of industry" and because it increases the stock of labor, which is one of the real riches a nation can have. On the flip side, Hume believed the worst possible policy was deflation as it decentivizes industry.
