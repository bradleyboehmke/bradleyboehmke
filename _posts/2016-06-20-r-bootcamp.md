I had my first meeting with the Business Analytics faculty at the University of Cincinnati [Department of Operations, Business Analytics and Information Systems](http://business.uc.edu/departments/obais.html) this week regarding this summer's first Intro to R Bootcamp course being offered to the incoming M.S. students.  The meeting went great and I feel like we're all on the same page regarding the objectives. Here are the main points and general outline aiming towards:

**Purpose:** To provide an intensive, hands-on introduction to the R programming language and prepare student with the fundamental programming skills required to start their journey to becoming a modern day data analyst via the M.S. Business Analytics curriculum.

**Objectives:** The goal is to get students aware of the general approaches of using R for the following purposes:

- Getting started with R
- Dealing with different types of data
- Managing data structures
- Importing & exporting data
- Shaping and transforming your data
- Descriptive statistics
- Base R graphics
- ggplot graphics library
- visualizing distributions
- visualizing categorical data
- visualizing 2 variables
- visualizing time series
- visualizing 3+ variables

**Description:** Here are some of the generalities that we understand now regarding the bootcamp:

- Dates: Aug 6-7
- Intro to R (4hr) – Saturday afternoon (Aug 6)
- Visualization (4hr) – Sunday afternoon (Aug 7)
- Population – incoming M.S. students, 8 Ph.D., technical crowd (80-90 students)
-	We want to make the bootcamp a working session
- Send out newsletter to have them have R and RStudio installed prior to the workshop
- We're thinking about having one or two data set examples where we can go through the whole data wrangling/initial EDA pipeline: importing the data, cleaning, subsetting, summarizing, visualizing
- Operate out of central GitHub repository to easily provide resources to the students
- We may record the sessions to turn into podcasts
