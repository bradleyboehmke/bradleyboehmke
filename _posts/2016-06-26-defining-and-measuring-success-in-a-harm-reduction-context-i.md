## Study Questions

To give an account of their accomplishments, most regulators would like to:

1. Demonstrate that their own actions had actually caused reductions in specific identified risk areas.
2. Take credit for accidents prevented.
3. Define long-term success in a risk-control setting (and in a way that doesn’t put
them out of business if they actually succeed!).

**Q1:** Which of these three do you think they will be able to do? 

**Q2:** In each case, why or why not? 

**Q3:** And, if not, what is the closest approximation to these ideals that is actually feasible?

**#1:** I believe if the initiatives are set up in a way that allows you to do some form of a modified DOE so that you can measure the counter factual then you ought to be able to measure #1. However, the key idea here is that the *effort* that causes the reduction be identified. If referring to individual *regulators* then the next step is to demonstrate the regulators role in the successful effort. However, this becomes much harder to do than in functional processes because regulators with different backgrounds and technical expertise are mixed together to problem solve. This becomes a melding of ideas, analyses, efforts that makes it much more difficult to measure the direct impact of a single regulator.

**#2:** If you are able to perform an experimental approach to the risk control problem solving then you should be able to make the case for, and illustrate, the effort that caused a reduction in accidents.  This allows the effort to take credit, which should allow the regulators involved in the effort to get some credit. Whether the latter will happen is uncertain; however, what is most important is that the effort causing a reduction in harm be recognized and gain publicity.

**#3:** Long-term success in risk/harm-control is difficult to measure. Long-term success in functional and process activities are much easier because you can develop performance measurement systems to continually monitor these activities and illustrate improved effectiveness and/or efficiency. However, risks do not behave like functions or processes.  They can often pop up and present themselves with little history to compare against (i.e. port-running problem). So to define long-term success in risk-control is to define long-term success in *strategic problem solving*. The reading outlines four specific properties of successful risk-control inventions (aka problem solving):

1. The problem-solving invention addressed specific, tightly defined concentrations of harm, rather than generalities or broad classes of harm. In other words they pick apart the macro-level risk to identify the micro-level risk that an intervention can directly impact.

2. The problem-solving process involved a prolonged period of analysis and inspection, before any new action was initiated. For example in the Boston project, several different hypotheses about *what the problem really was* were tested and discarded before the relationship between juvenile homicides and gang-hostilities was finally established.

3. Having understood the problem and defined it precisely, the interventions that resulted were not merely a mixture of existing functions or methods: they were qualitatively new. And the methods were not novel for the sake of being novel; they were novel because the problems to be addressed had not responded to the standard treatments, and therefore required novel ones.

4. Successful risk-control involves multiple agencies and organizations working in collaboration. 

If an organization can address risks with problem-solving that contains these properties they should have long-term success in risk-control.


## Class Notes
Three key issues to always keep in mind:

1. Can we prove causality?
2. How do we measure prevention?
3. How do we define long-term success?

Risk control

- synonyms: risks, harms, threats, issues, problems
- identify: trends, clusters, anomalies, patterns
- goals: elminate, reduce, mitigate, suppressed, prevented

Organizations are typically built

- functionally (often by function and by geographic location)
- process oriented 

And performance measurements typically focus on 

- accuracy
- timeliness
- volume
- cost efficiency
- client satisfaction

There is *no linkage* between these performance measurements and risk-control
