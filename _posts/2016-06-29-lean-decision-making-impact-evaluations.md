## Session

- DATE: Tuesday, June 28
- TIME: 1:30 â€“ 3:00 pm
- CLASS: Lean Decision-Making Impact Evaluations
- INSTRUCTOR: Neil Buddy Shah ([IDinsight.org](http://idinsight.org/))

## Session Notes

Is an evaluation worth the cost

- How many people will the decision impact
- How much money will the decision influence
- What is the quality of the evidence

Practical tips to decrease cost and time

- Smaller, focused questionnaires
- Proximate outcome variables - if outcome is well established in literature then we can measure intermediate outcomes (i.e. strong evidence in literature shows that mosquito nets reduces maleria so we don't need to measure death, instead measure other variables that are "upstream" from these longterm outcomes)
- Skip baseline survey is not needed
- Seek out larger, policy relevant effects sizes which creates smaller sample sizes
- Rolling sample sizes, early stopping rules
- Existing data and data collection systems
- Electronic surveys/mobile data collection


- Need to balance scientific rigor with operational decision-making - provided good slides where comparisons were made to weight the cost and benefits of RCTs vs Matching with difference-in-differences
- Be very critical regarding the design trade-offs
- You can do rigorous impact evaluations that are targeted towards decision-making and balances scientific rigor
