Welcome to my open science notebook. This is the active, permanent record of all my scientific research, standing in place of the traditional bound lab notebook. It is a record of ideas, and intuitions; results and mistakes. Please bear in mind that the notebook is primarily a tool for me to do science, not communicate it. I write my entries with the hope that they are intelligible to my future self; and maybe intelligible to my collaborators and experts in my field. This is not a research blog, where each entry can be read alone and understood by a general audience in an edited and polished form. ((Okay, with the exception of those items posted in my Open Notebook Science category, which is more like a blog.  These entries still include me experimenting with  methods, tools and ideas, but are written with more of an audience in mind.))
