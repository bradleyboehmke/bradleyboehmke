I'm an analytics enthusiast who enjoys producing high quality, reproducible analytic approaches to real world problems.  I believe in a methodical approach that provides fundamental understanding of the problem through the application of descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytic techniques.

Currently, I am an Operations Research Analyst at HQ Air Force Materiel Command, Studies and Analyses Division (HQ AFMC/A9) at Wright-Patterson AFB and have performed analytic services to the Air Force via multiple roles since 2003.  My research primarily focuses on strategic cost analytics to provide senior leadership robust understanding of economic behavior across the Air Force enterprise.  

I earned my Ph.D. from the Operational Sciences department at the Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT), which focused on applying advanced analytics to understand and manage indirect cost behavior across the Air Force enterprise.  I received my M.S. in Cost Analytics at AFIT and attended undergrad at North Dakota State University.  My academic research has focused on cost analysis, business analytics, econometric modeling, decision analysis, and developing applied modeling applications through the R statistical language. 

I am from Minnesota but have lived in North Dakota, Colorado, Iowa, and have been in the Dayton, Ohio area since 2006.  I am married and have two beautiful daughters.
