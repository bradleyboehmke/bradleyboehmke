Welcome to my open science notebook. This is the active, permanent record of all my scientific research, standing in place of the traditional bound lab notebook. It is a record of ideas, and intuitions; results and mistakes. Please bear in mind that the notebook is primarily a tool for me to do science, not communicate it. I write my entries with the hope that they are intelligible to my future self; and maybe intelligible to my collaborators and experts in my field. This is not a research blog, where each entry can be read alone and understood by a general audience in an edited and polished form. Although I may occasionally post blog-like entries, and many of my initally posts were more blog-like focused, the emphasis will remain on maintaining a log of my scientific inquiries.
