<p>
I am a Senior Operations Research Analyst for the U.S. Air Force. My research primarily focuses on economic and decision analyses to provide senior leadership robust understanding of economic behavior and potential policy impacts for the Air Force enterprise. 
</p>

<p>
I am also an adjunct assistant professor at the <a href="http://www.afit.edu/">Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT)</a>. My <a href="http://bradleyboehmke.github.io/cv/#publications">academic research</a> focuses on developing econometric models, algorithms and applications for forecasting, analyzing and visualizing data. I’ve also dabbled in text analysis and written a <a href="https://leanpub.com/datawranglingwithr">book on data wrangling with R</a>.  
</p>

<p>
I earned my Ph.D. from the Operational Sciences department at AFIT, which focused on applying advanced analytics to understand and manage indirect cost behavior across the Air Force enterprise. I received my M.S. in Cost Analytics at AFIT and earned my B.S. at North Dakota State University. 
<p>

</p>
In my free time I’m an avid reader, I enjoy tooling around with socio-economic data, and occasionally <a href="http://bradleyboehmke.github.io/">blog</a> about analytics, hacking, and socio-economic artifacts.
