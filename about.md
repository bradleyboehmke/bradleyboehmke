Welcome to my open science notebook. This is the active, permanent record of all my scientific research, standing in place of the traditional bound scientific notebook. It is a record of ideas, analyses, results and mistakes. The concept of open science is to make scientific research, data and dissemination accessible to all levels of an inquiring society, amateur or professional. Therefore, an open science notebook is a researchers effort to making the entire primary record of a research project (or as much as possible) publicly available online as it is recorded. This OpenSci notebook is my effort to join the open science community. <img src="http://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/.a/6a00d8341c464853ef01bb08acc6b1970d-580wi" alt="Brad" align="right" style="width: 42%; height: 42%; margin:8px">

Please bear in mind that the notebook is primarily a tool for me to do, and keep track of, scientific inquiry. I write my entries with the hope that they are intelligible to my future self; and maybe intelligible to my collaborators and experts in my field. This is not a research blog, where each entry can be read alone and understood by a general audience in an edited and polished form. Although I may occasionally post blog-like entries, and many of my initally posts were more blog-like focused, the emphasis will remain on maintaining a log of my scientific inquiries.
