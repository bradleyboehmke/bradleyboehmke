<br>

When assumptions are broken we stop being able to draw accurate conclusions about reality. Different statistitical models assume different things, and if these models are going to reflect reality accurately then these assumptions need to be true. Parametric models are statistical techniques (i.e. regression, means testing, factorial designs) designed for use when data have certain distributional characteristics.[^char] For data to be parametric certain assumptions must be fulfilled; if you use a parametric test when your data are not parametric then the results are likely to be inaccurate. Therefore, it is very important that you check the assumptions before deciding which statistical test is appropriate.

* [Assumption of Homogeneity](assumptions_homogeneity)


<br>

[^char]: Most commonly when data approximate a normal distribution and are measurable with interval or ratio scales.
