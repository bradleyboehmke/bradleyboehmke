<p>
<ul> 
<li>Currently creating a text analysis capability to provide senior Air Force decision-makers with the ability to text mine planning and programming documents. This will provide an additional means to <em>i</em>) cross- validate document findings with human comprehension, and <em>ii</em>) to identify key document attributes of interest to planning and programming personnel for further investigation.
<li>Established a Data Envelopment Analysis methodology to benchmark installation support activities across the Air Force enterprise. Provides Air Force leadership with the ability to isolate best practices, identify potential cost savings, and establish performance expectations with available resources.</li>
<li>Applied a novel growth curve clustering approach to identify underlying cost curve behavior across the
Air Force enterprise. Aides decision-makers in directing their focus, proposals, and policy actions towards
specific growth curves in the current <em>Bending the Cost Curve</em> initiative.</li>
<li>Assessed and identified valid univariate metrics in addition to establishing a forecasting methodology
to serve as a resource allocation tool for the LGM-30 Intercontinental Ballistic Missile weapon system
parts. Contributes to Air Force Global Strike Command's initiative to better align itself with the
aircraft operating business.</li>
<li>Analyzed Air Force <em>Tooth-to-Tail</em> relationships using a multilevel regression approach to assess the
magnitude and variability of the relationship across the multiple levels of the Air Force enterprise.
Illustrates economic trends previously concealed by historical aggregate analysis performed in this
area.</li>
<li>Created a text-mining algorithm to analyze contract description text and identify the most frequently
used descriptors. Allows the contracting organization to categorize contract spend at lower fidelity.</li>
<li>Developed and coded an interactive data mining and visualization tool to assist in analyzing and
validating Air Force weapon system requirements. Provides decision-makers with real-time analysis of
weapon system requirements.</li>
</ul>

<br style="text-align:left;"><em>Decision Analyst</em></span><span style="float:right;">Dayton, OH</span>
</p>
<p>
<ul> 
<li>Provided key statistical, cost and logistics research and technical support to the AFIT Center for
Operational Analysis (COA). Assisted faculty and students in transitioning academic ideas into usable
products for the Air Force.</li>
<li>Analyzed inventory model comparing full versus semi-variance parameters for demand and lead-time
variables to forecast safety stock requirements for the F-16 program. Incorporated an Excel general
user interface which allows decision makers to quickly view stock shortage risks dependent on parameter
inputs.</li>
<li>As lead cost estimator for the KC-46 Maintenance Training Systems developed a feature-based life
cycle cost estimate to decompose costs into individual processes and activities. In addition, created an
interactive schedule with the life cycle cost estimate so that decision makers can assess cost impacts
from acquisition delays, total production quantities and lot sizes, and secondary delays due to potential
KC-46 acquisition delays.</li>
<li>As lead cost estimator for the Global Hawk Business Case Analysis developed a generative cost model
and directed the implementation of the various sensitivity analyses to identify cost and risk drivers
using Crystal Ball software and Monte Carlo simulation. In addition, worked with the logistics lead to
incorporate an analytic hierarchy process as a multi-criteria decision approach to establish a cost-benefit
comparison.</li>
<li>As lead cost estimator for the Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization program established an integrated
lifecycle cost estimate which included, but was not limited to: using PRICE cost estimating software
to develop the software cost estimate, man-hour workload and schedule length based on SLOC count
and sophistication of software programming; forecasted operations and support costs by analyzing and
adjusting historical costs for engine fuel efficiency, adjusting maintenance costs for weight by creating
a historical relationship between the predecessor aircraft weight and historical maintenance costs, and
forecasting new utilization rates; and integrating limited historical data, vendor quotes and subject
matter expert inputs for green aircraft procurement costs.</li>
<li>Provided a six week training course on Crystal Ball software which included what-if analyses with
Monte Carlo simulations, tting distributions, assessing correlations; analyzing historical data with
time-series analysis and regression, performing constraint-based optimality models, etc.</li>
</ul>
