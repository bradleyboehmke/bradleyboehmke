</p>
<ul>
  <li>Currently leading a 3 person team in providing analytic support to the Air Force Installation & Mission Support Center. The aim is to develop a framework to <em>i</em>) assess the performance of installation and mission support (I&MS) activities across the AF enterprise, <em>ii</em>) provide a cost vs. capability risk assessment for I&MS activities and, <em>iii</em>) link these risks to mission outputs. Provides senior leadership with an enterprise perspective of the health of I&MS activities and aid in optimizing the $10B in I&MS resources while minimizing risk to mission performance</li>
  <li>Collaborating with Dr. Mark Gallagher (AF/A9) and Dr. David Nicholls (IDA) to organize the first Air Force Infrastructure Cost Research Meeting to bring more focus to the $30B support cost portfolio.</li>
  <li>Lead analyst in promoting and establishing requirements for an HQ AFMC/A9 Analytics and Data Science Lab (ADSL). The ADSL aims to bring cutting-edge resources and space for collaboration and training to WPAFB OR analysts along with serving a broader role by providing analytic support to
the AFMC Centers.</li>
  <li>Worked with the HQ AFMC/A9 Technical Expert, Strategic Studies Group to establish a text analysis capability to provide senior Air Force decision-makers with the ability to mine strategic planning and programming text documents. Provides an additional means to <em>i</em>) cross-validate document findings with human comprehension, and <em>ii</em>) to identify key document attributes of interest to planning and programming personnel for further investigation.</li>
  <li>Lead analyst (1 of 5) in methodology development, analytic implementation, and report writing for a decision support tool that applies econometric modeling and Bayesian networks to model support cost consequences from force structure policy considerations. Provides senior Air Force decision-makers with visual illustration of cause-and-effect impacts, the ability to model uncertainty in the decision environment, and the ability to perform predictive and diagnostic reasoning in light of new information available to decision-makers.</li>
  <li>Lead analyst (1 of 6) in methodology development, analytic implementation, and report writing for a Data Envelopment Analysis approach to benchmark installation support activities across the Air Force enterprise. In the process identified over $130M in resource inefficiencies across the AF enterprise. This novel methodology provides Air Force leadership with the ability to isolate best practices, identify potential cost savings, and establish performance expectations with available resources.</li>
  <li>Lead analyst (1 of 5) in methodology development, analytic implementation, and report writing for a novel growth curve clustering approach to identify underlying cost curve behavior across the Air Force enterprise’s $30B support cost portfolio. Aides decision-makers to direct their focus, proposals, and policy actions towards specific growth curves in the current <em>Bending the Cost Curve</em> initiative.</li>
  <li>Led a 2 person team in assessing and identifying valid univariate metrics along with establishing a forecasting methodology to serve as a resource allocation tool for the LGM-30 Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) weapon system parts. Provided leadership with robust approach to forecast funding needs for the $30M ICBM parts portfolio and contributed to Air Force Global Strike Command’s initiative to better align itself with the aircraft operating business.</li>
   <li>Lead analyst (1 of 5) in methodology development, analytic implementation, and report writing for analyzing Air Force <em>Tooth-to-Tail</em> relationships using a multilevel regression approach to assess the magnitude and variability of the relationship across the multiple levels of the Air Force enterprise. Illustrates economic trends previously concealed by historical aggregate analysis performed in this area.</li>
  <li>Led a 2 person team in creating a text-mining algorithm to analyze contract description text and identifying the most frequently used descriptors. Allows the contracting organization to categorize contract spend at lower fidelity.</li>
  <li>Developed and coded an interactive data mining and visualization tool to assist in analyzing and
validating Air Force weapon system requirements. Provides decision-makers with real-time analysis of
weapon system requirements.</li>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Booz | Allen | Hamilton</strong></span><span style="float:right;">June 2009 - June 2014</span>
<br style="text-align:left;"><em>Decision Analyst</em></span><span style="float:right;">Dayton, OH</span>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Provided key statistical, cost and logistics research and technical support to the AFIT Center for
Operational Analysis (COA). Assisted faculty and students in transitioning academic ideas into usable
products for the Air Force.</li>
    <li>Analyzed inventory model comparing full versus semi-variance parameters for demand and lead-time
variables to forecast safety stock requirements for the F-16 program. Incorporated an Excel general
user interface which allows decision makers to quickly view stock shortage risks dependent on parameter
inputs.</li>
    <li>As lead cost estimator for the KC-46 Maintenance Training Systems developed a feature-based life
cycle cost estimate to decompose costs into individual processes and activities. In addition, created an
interactive schedule with the life cycle cost estimate so that decision makers can assess cost impacts
from acquisition delays, total production quantities and lot sizes, and secondary delays due to potential
KC-46 acquisition delays.</li>
    <li>As lead cost estimator for the Global Hawk Business Case Analysis developed a generative cost model
and directed the implementation of the various sensitivity analyses to identify cost and risk drivers
using Crystal Ball software and Monte Carlo simulation. In addition, worked with the logistics lead to
incorporate an analytic hierarchy process as a multi-criteria decision approach to establish a cost-benefit
comparison.</li>
    <li>As lead cost estimator for the Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization program established an integrated
lifecycle cost estimate which included, but was not limited to: using PRICE cost estimating software
to develop the software cost estimate, man-hour workload and schedule length based on SLOC count
and sophistication of software programming; forecasted operations and support costs by analyzing and
adjusting historical costs for engine fuel efficiency, adjusting maintenance costs for weight by creating
a historical relationship between the predecessor aircraft weight and historical maintenance costs, and
forecasting new utilization rates; and integrating limited historical data, vendor quotes and subject
matter expert inputs for green aircraft procurement costs.</li>
    <li>Provided a six week training course on Crystal Ball software which included what-if analyses with
Monte Carlo simulations, fitting distributions, assessing correlations; analyzing historical data with
time-series analysis and regression, performing constraint-based optimality models, etc.</li>
