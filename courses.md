## Data Wrangling with R
Data wrangling can be a painstakenly laborious process. In fact, its been stated that up to 80% of data analysis is spent on the process of cleaning and preparing data. However, being a prerequisite to the rest of the data analysis workflow (visualization, analysis, reporting), it’s important to become fluent and efficient with data wrangling techniques. This 7 week course offered as part of [University of Cincinnati's](http://www.uc.edu/) [Master of Science in Business Analytics ](http://business.uc.edu/graduate/ms-business-analytics.html) program teaches the essentials of preprocessing data leveraging the R programming language to easily and quickly turn noisy data into usable pieces of information. &nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://uc-r.github.io/bana_datawrangling" style="color:black;"><i class="fa fa-folder-open" style="font-size:1em"></i></a>

Doing this well involves the integration of your suppliers who are experts at what they do.
